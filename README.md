## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of TypeScript scripts demonstrating basic interactions with Voltr Vaults on the Solana blockchain. They cover core functionalities like initializing and managing vaults, depositing and withdrawing assets for users, and querying vault/user state.

These scripts serve as a starting point and example for building more complex integrations with the Voltr protocol.

---

## Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js v18+**
    Ensure you have Node.js version 18 or higher installed.

2.  **pnpm**
    This project uses pnpm for package management. Install it if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```
    Or see the [pnpm website](https://pnpm.io/installation).

3.  **Solana Keypairs**
    You'll need separate Solana keypair files (in JSON format) for the following roles:
    *   **Admin:** Manages vault configuration and fee harvesting.
    *   **Manager:** Designated during vault initialization (role specified by Voltr protocol, used in init/harvest).
    *   **User:** Interacts with the vault (deposit/withdraw).

    Store these JSON files securely on your filesystem.

4.  **Solana RPC URL**
    A reliable Solana RPC endpoint URL is required. The scripts are configured to use a Helius RPC URL provided via an environment variable, but any compatible RPC should work.

---

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url> voltr-base-scripts
    cd voltr-base-scripts
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

---

## Configuration

Configuration requires setting environment variables and editing the `config/base.ts` file.

### Environment Variables (Required)

These scripts expect the following environment variables to be set, pointing to your keypair files and RPC URL:

*   `ADMIN_FILE_PATH`: Absolute path to the Admin keypair JSON file.
*   `MANAGER_FILE_PATH`: Absolute path to the Manager keypair JSON file.
*   `USER_FILE_PATH`: Absolute path to the User keypair JSON file.
*   `HELIUS_RPC_URL`: Your Solana RPC endpoint URL.

**Example (using .env file or exporting):**

```bash
export ADMIN_FILE_PATH="/path/to/your/admin.json"
export MANAGER_FILE_PATH="/path/to/your/manager.json"
export USER_FILE_PATH="/path/to/your/user.json"
export HELIUS_RPC_URL="https://your-rpc-provider-url"
```

**Security Note:** Never commit your private key JSON files to version control. Keep them secure and use environment variables or a secure secrets management system.

### Configuration File (`config/base.ts`)

This file contains parameters for vault operations. You **must** edit this file before running scripts.

*   **Vault Initialization (Needed for `admin-init-vault.ts`)**
    *   `vaultConfig`: An object defining parameters like `maxCap`, fees (`managerPerformanceFee`, `adminPerformanceFee`, etc.), `lockedProfitDegradationDuration`, `redemptionFee`, `issuanceFee`, `withdrawalWaitingPeriod`.
    *   `vaultParams`: Contains `vaultConfig` and basic metadata like `name`, `description`.

*   **Core Vault Details**
    *   `assetMintAddress`: **Required.** The public key (string) of the token mint that will be deposited into the vault (e.g., USDC, SOL).
    *   `assetTokenProgram`: **Required.** The public key (string) of the SPL Token program governing the `assetMintAddress` (e.g., `Tokenkeg...` for SPL Token, `Tokenz...` for Token-2022).
    *   `vaultAddress`: **Required after initialization.** Leave empty initially. After running `admin-init-vault.ts`, paste the outputted vault public key here.

*   **Transaction Optimization (Optional)**
    *   `useLookupTable`: Boolean. Set to `true` to create and use an Address Lookup Table (LUT) during initialization for potentially cheaper transactions.
    *   `lookupTableAddress`: **Required if `useLookupTable` is true.** Leave empty initially. After running `admin-init-vault.ts` with `useLookupTable: true`, paste the outputted LUT public key here.

*   **Action Parameters (Needed for deposit/withdraw scripts)**
    *   `depositAmountVault`: The amount of the base asset (in its smallest unit, e.g., lamports for SOL, 10^6 for USDC) to deposit.
    *   `withdrawAmountVault`: The amount to withdraw. Interpretation depends on `isWithdrawInLp`.
    *   `isWithdrawAll`: Boolean. If `true`, attempts to withdraw the user's entire position, overriding `withdrawAmountVault`.
    *   `isWithdrawInLp`: Boolean. If `true`, `withdrawAmountVault` is interpreted as the amount of *LP tokens* to withdraw. If `false`, it's interpreted as the amount of the *underlying asset* to withdraw.

---

## Available Scripts

Run scripts using `pnpm ts-node <script_path>`. Ensure environment variables are set and `config/base.ts` is updated appropriately for the script you are running.

### Admin Scripts

*   **`src/scripts/admin-init-vault.ts`**
    *   Initializes a new Voltr vault using the Admin as payer and designates the Manager.
    *   Requires `vaultConfig`, `vaultParams`, `assetMintAddress`, `assetTokenProgram` in `base.ts`.
    *   Outputs the new `vaultAddress` and `lookupTableAddress` (if `useLookupTable` is true). **You must update `base.ts` with these values after running.**
    *   Uses `ADMIN_FILE_PATH` and `MANAGER_FILE_PATH`.

*   **`src/scripts/admin-update-vault.ts`**
    *   Updates the configuration (`vaultConfig`) of an existing vault.
    *   Requires `vaultAddress` and the desired `vaultConfig` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `ADMIN_FILE_PATH`.

*   **`src/scripts/admin-harvest-fee.ts`**
    *   Collects accumulated performance and protocol fees from the vault, distributing them to Admin, Manager, and Protocol Admin.
    *   Requires `vaultAddress` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `ADMIN_FILE_PATH` and `MANAGER_FILE_PATH`.

### User Scripts

*   **`src/scripts/user-deposit-vault.ts`**
    *   Deposits a specified amount (`depositAmountVault`) of the vault's asset token from the User's account into the vault, receiving LP tokens in return.
    *   Handles wSOL wrapping/unwrapping if `assetMintAddress` is the native SOL mint.
    *   Requires `vaultAddress`, `assetMintAddress`, `assetTokenProgram`, `depositAmountVault` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `USER_FILE_PATH`.

*   **`src/scripts/user-request-withdraw-vault.ts`**
    *   Initiates a withdrawal request for the User. Fails if another request is pending.
    *   Uses `withdrawAmountVault`, `isWithdrawInLp`, `isWithdrawAll` from `base.ts`.
    *   Requires `vaultAddress` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `USER_FILE_PATH`.

*   **`src/scripts/user-withdraw-vault.ts`**
    *   Completes a previously requested withdrawal after any waiting period has passed. Fails if no request was made or the waiting period isn't over.
    *   Handles wSOL unwrapping if necessary.
    *   Requires `vaultAddress`, `assetMintAddress`, `assetTokenProgram` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `USER_FILE_PATH`.

*   **`src/scripts/user-request-and-withdraw-vault.ts`**
    *   Combines the request and withdrawal steps into a single transaction.
    *   **Only works if the vault's `withdrawalWaitingPeriod` in `vaultConfig` is set to 0.**
    *   Uses `withdrawAmountVault`, `isWithdrawInLp`, `isWithdrawAll` from `base.ts`.
    *   Requires `vaultAddress`, `assetMintAddress`, `assetTokenProgram` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `USER_FILE_PATH`.

### Query Scripts

*   **`src/scripts/user-query-position.ts`**
    *   Fetches the User's current LP token balance and calculates the approximate equivalent value in the underlying vault asset (both before and after potential withdrawal fees/degradation).
    *   Requires `vaultAddress` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `USER_FILE_PATH`.

*   **`src/scripts/query-strategy-positions.ts`**
    *   Fetches the vault account data, displays the total asset value, and lists any initialized strategy allocations (showing strategy address and position value).
    *   Requires `vaultAddress` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `ADMIN_FILE_PATH` (implicitly via RPC connection, though no signing needed).

## Basic Usage Flow

1.  **Configure Environment:** Set the `ADMIN_FILE_PATH`, `MANAGER_FILE_PATH`, `USER_FILE_PATH`, and `HELIUS_RPC_URL` environment variables.
2.  **Configure Vault Parameters:** Edit `config/base.ts`. Fill in `vaultConfig`, `vaultParams`, `assetMintAddress`, `assetTokenProgram`. Decide on `useLookupTable`. Leave `vaultAddress` and `lookupTableAddress` empty for now.
3.  **Initialize Vault (Admin):**
    ```bash
    pnpm ts-node src/scripts/admin-init-vault.ts
    ```
4.  **Update Config:** Copy the outputted `Vault:` and `Lookup Table:` (if used) addresses and paste them into the `vaultAddress` and `lookupTableAddress` fields in `config/base.ts`.
5.  **Update Vault (Admin, Optional):** If you need to change config after init:
    ```bash
    pnpm ts-node src/scripts/admin-update-vault.ts
    ```
6.  **Deposit (User):** Set `depositAmountVault` in `config/base.ts`.
    ```bash
    pnpm ts-node src/scripts/user-deposit-vault.ts
    ```
7.  **Check Position (User):**
    ```bash
    pnpm ts-node src/scripts/user-query-position.ts
    ```
8.  **Withdraw (User):** Set withdrawal parameters (`withdrawAmountVault`, `isWithdrawInLp`, `isWithdrawAll`) in `config/base.ts`.
    *   **If `withdrawalWaitingPeriod` > 0:**
        ```bash
        # Step 1: Request
        pnpm ts-node src/scripts/user-request-withdraw-vault.ts
        # Step 2: Wait for the period, then withdraw
        pnpm ts-node src/scripts/user-withdraw-vault.ts
        ```
    *   **If `withdrawalWaitingPeriod` == 0:**
        ```bash
        pnpm ts-node src/scripts/user-request-and-withdraw-vault.ts
        ```
9.  **Harvest Fees (Admin):**
    ```bash
    pnpm ts-node src/scripts/admin-harvest-fee.ts
    ```
10. **Query Strategies (Admin/General):**
    ```bash
    pnpm ts-node src/scripts/query-strategy-positions.ts
    ```
